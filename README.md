This SwiftIODemo contains an outdated version of SwiftGraphics. The API seems to have changed greatly after SwiftIO switched to offical embeded Swift toolchains. But it still remains the best and most comprehensive reference to the upcoming MadGraphics package.

Currently, the `mm-sdk` also contains a binary version of MadGraphics. And MadExamples (develop branch) have few more working examples. By referencing both side. We could probably paint a quite full picture of the MadGraphics package.
